This repository contains my own works regarding [lierolibre](https://gitlab.com/lierolibre/lierolibre) - a direct fork of Liero 1.35b, created by Martin Erik Werner and released in 2012. It is a project to liberate [Liero](https://liero.be/) from all its proprietary components and to allow it to be distributed completely freely. The clone itself features a new non-proprietary soundpack, but is otherwise true to the game you were used to back in the nineties. Being completely re-engineered it is also easier to mod than the other games and does not use the original Liero files. Enjoy!
